       <h2>The "I don't want your data" Privacy Policy</h2>
       <p>
        I don't want your data.<br>
        I don't want to pay for compute or storage to handle or store your data.<br>
        Nor do I want to setup up third-party agents that'll collect your data.
       </p>
       <p>
        The site just runs on the client side with no server backend, this includes storage and processing of images you 'upload' (though not really upload).<em>All the features are accomplished through vanila JS enbracing the DOM. Hit <code>F12</code> to see it all if you wish.</em>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you find something on this site that is collecting your data, that is not some browser extension you installed, let me know, I'll be very curious as to how it got there...
